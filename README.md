# Spotify Clone

## Project Overview

This project is a clone of the Spotify application, aiming to replicate the core features of the popular music streaming platform. The primary functionalities include:

- **Listen to Music:** Users can play their favorite music seamlessly within the application.
  
- **Add Songs:** The ability to add new songs to the user's library or playlist.

- **Favorites:** Users can mark songs as favorites, making it easier to access and enjoy their preferred tracks.

- **Volume Control:** A feature allowing users to adjust the volume of the currently playing music or mute it.

- **Account Management:** Users can create accounts and log in to personalize their experience, including accessing saved songs and playlists.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages the following technologies:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture for a modular and maintainable codebase.

- **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications, enhancing performance and SEO.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and clean user interfaces. It simplifies styling by using pre-defined classes.

- **Supabase:** A cloud database service that includes features for authentication, real-time data, and storage. Supabase is used for managing user accounts and storing music-related data.

- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful open-source relational database system, used in conjunction with Supabase to store and organize structured data efficiently.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured organization to maintain clarity and scalability:

- **`src/`**: Contains the React components, pages, and other frontend-related code.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable React components.
  - **`pages/`**: Different pages of the application.
  - **`styles/`**: Stylesheets and Tailwind CSS configurations.

- **`public/`**: Static assets such as images and fonts.

- **`server/`**: Backend server logic, if needed (e.g., handling API requests to Supabase).

- **`database/`**: Database-related configurations and scripts for initializing the database schema.

- **`docs/`**: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Configure Supabase credentials and PostgreSQL connection.
4. Run the application: `npm run dev`.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how users can interact with the application, including account creation, song addition, volume control, etc.

## Roadmap

Outline future enhancements, features, or optimizations planned for the project.
